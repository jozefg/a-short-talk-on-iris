## a-short-talk-on-iris

These are the notes for a short talk to be given in Steve Brookes's
seminar on concurrent separation logic. They may be built using
`latexmk -pdf notes.tex`. These notes are largely intended to be for
me to get my thoughts in order, not necessarily for human
consumption.

The code for the example is found in `demo/`. It can be built by
invoking `make`.

If you want to study Iris, more polished introductions may be found
with [here](http://iris-project.org/tutorial-material.html). I am just
not capable of giving a chalk talk without writing some document like
this first.
